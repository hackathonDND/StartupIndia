# StartupIndia
StartupIndia App Developed under Final round of Smart India Hackathon 2017. </br>
It is an Android Application, an upgrade to already existing StartUp India app to improve UI and UX. </br>
Due to limited credentials of not being a government employee, program organisers denied to give access to their server, which in FAQs they agreed to. Therefore, project included fully function UI without server connection.


#### Note: Since, the app was developed under T&Cs of SIH2017, it was a proprietry software until the final phase of development. It DID NOT get selected as a Winner of Competetion, therefore it can be used as a OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE NOW.
